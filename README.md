Honors Project mobile learning app

My name is Ryan Gallacher, I am currently undertaking my honours project - Development of an M-Learning app for Android.

I would like to invite you to participate in completing this questionnaire in an attempt to gain external views/opinions on whether the application successfully achieves the usability and mobile HCI guidelines identified to develop a mobile learning app. Questions consist of multiple choice or how much you agree with a particular statement in relation to the mobile learning application provided. 

Participation Requirements:
You must be 18 years of age or above, and own a mobile device (tablet, smart phone).

If you would like to participate please read the below information, you can stop participation at any point in time. If you have any questions or uncertainties please feel free to contact me. By completing the questionnaire you consent to the data acquired being used within the evaluation of the application to draw conclusions, and submission of the final report. All data will be anonymized .

Aim of Project: To develop and evaluate an effective m-learning app for android devices. Its purpose is to support an introduction to HTML and CSS, allowing the students to develop their knowledge in a more informal setting outside of the classroom. This will be accomplished using google drive, short snippets of information through a variety of multimedia along with quiz challenges to test student understanding. The app will be used alongside current resources.

Points to note: 
 - The Google drive feature was uncompleted within the time frame. This feature could be added in future iterations. The purpose of     this   feature was intended to allow the user(s) access to learning materials within the same application.
 
 - In the Revision Material Section, "Real Information" is used in  BASIC HTML, BASIC CSS, Colors while the other topics are filled with fake text. These extra topics are simply to demonstrate how the app would look if more topics were added.
 
 - Furthermore Known bug: when in "portraite" in the video tutorial section, if you select fullscreen the app will freeze/crash. However if you rotate to landscape first then select fullscreen this works as expected.

Thank you for having an interest in this project and taking the time to read this sheet.
